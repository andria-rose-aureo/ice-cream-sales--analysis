### 📊 Ice Cream Sales Analysis

This project performs a basic data analysis and visualization of an imaginary ice cream shop’s daily sales. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it demonstrates:

* A bar plot showing daily ice cream sales across the week
* A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales

#### 📁 Data Used:

| Day       | Temperature (°C) | Ice Cream Sales |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Monday    | 30               | 200             |
| Tuesday   | 32               | 220             |
| Wednesday | 28               | 180             |
